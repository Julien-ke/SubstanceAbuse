# DataSet

The dataset I'm using can be found [here](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html).
This dataset is obtained by performing a query on the host site. Make sure to perform a GroupBy by "State" and "Year".

The data contain information on deaths in the United States from 1995 to 2015. I'm trying to create a visualization of data that can easily identify certain events that may have caused an increase or decrease in mortality.

The map in my data visualization is interactive. Clicking on a report displays the demographic data for that report.
